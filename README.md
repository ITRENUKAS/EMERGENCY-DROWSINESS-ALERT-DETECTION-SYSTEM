EMERGENCY DROWSINESS ALERT DETECTION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING
Every hour, there are numerous traffic accidents worldwide. These accidents can be dangerous for both drivers and passengers since they result from drunk driving, sleep deprivation, and a host of other factors. These indicators indicate an inappropriate driving condition. EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) calculates the ratio of distances between horizontal and vertical eye landmarks to identify tiredness. The driver's eyes are monitored by a small monochrome security camera that is aimed directly at the driver's face by the system to identify signs of drowsiness. When a motorist exhibits signs of fatigue, a warning signal is sent to notify them. To identify yawns, the distance between the lower and upper lips is estimated and compared. versus a predetermined threshold value. Our espeak module (text-to-speech synthesizer) provides voice notifications for drivers who are tired or yawning.
